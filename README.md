This open source project tries to solve simple, but yet anoying problem with some motorcycles, and that problem is **Turn signals**! On older motorcyckles (mainly 80s and 90s, some even 00s) turn signal is totally mechanical and that means that user has to turn it off after every turn on the road. For me, I would rather enjoy the ride than think about this annoying problem. This is how **TurniClear** born!

## Features
- Automatically turn off turn signals after turn is completed (gyro controlled)
- 3 short pusles for changing lanes, indicating going from roundabout etc.
- Uses off the shelf, cheap gyro module
- Open Sourced!

## Whats next?

I'm currently working on PCB manufacturing and case's printed for this module.
Will be manufacturing 100pcs to begin with and then if more people want it I would make some more. :)
